# text-enhancer

## General information
This is a student project and future improvements can't be expected. Feel free to contribute or copy for other projects. 
MIT license applies.

## Purpose
A JavaScript module designed to make text more accessible across different web interfaces.
This module allows developers to target different text elements and provide end users with options such as:

- Resizing the text with a unit-aware logic
- Switching fonts for better readability (serif/sans as default, but other fonts can be added)
- Increasing contrast between text and background, by changing background and/or text color.

It is aimed to be especially useful for users with dyslexia (change of fonts), or other visual impairments that is helped by manipulating text size and other factors that affect the readability.

## Features

Resize text with some unit aware logic.
Switch fonts between serif and sans-serif depending on preferens (possible to add more sets of fonts, even dedicated ones for dyslexia).
Fallback for inconclusive inputs
Tested with jest and documented in `testrapport.md`

## Installation

```bash
npm install text-enhancer
```
## Usage
```JavaScript
import { createTextEnhancer } from 'text-enhancer'

const enhancer = createTextEnhancer({
  selectors: ['element', '.class', '#id'],
    step: '2px',
    minSize: 6,
    maxSize: 40,
    root: document
})

// Example: Improve readability for a user with low vision
enhancer.increaseTextSize() // makes targeted elements/classes/id's bigger
enhancer.cycleFontSet() // Cycles through different fonts if original is hard to read.
enhancer.applyColorTheme('highContrast') // Takes over styling of text-element and adds contrasting text- and background-color
```

## Testing

This module is tested with Jest for automated unit testing. All major logic is covered and all edgecases I could think of as well, such as fallback and conversions.

```bash
npm test
```
